 In "The Fed" you play as a combination of the Federal Reserve and the US Ferderal Government.
 You must decide how much money to print and who to give it to before the end of the year.
 Inspired by the massive stimulus packages given out by the government in april of 2020.
 
 Struggles included how to figure out how to animate the gif in the center of the screen.
 The gif is also the only non default asset used besides a free font found online.
 The only real expansion would be more detailed and numerous endings and much more time committed to 
 UI and art assets.
