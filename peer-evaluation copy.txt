	Corona has created problems in the economy. 

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?

	Something I liked in this game was the animation in the background. I really liked the use of an animated instead of still images.

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?

	I was confused at the beginning because everything was going so fast, maybe if I had more time to read everything. 

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?

	There were no errors when I played the game. It was well put together. 

Is it clear that every group member participated?

	Yes. 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 	Yes.

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

	I actually think the readme is quite descriptive for this game.
