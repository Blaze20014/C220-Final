What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?

I learned that you can create story based games in Godot with ease.

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?

The game reflects this theme based on you playing as the federal reserve distributing checks.

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?

I liked the animation that they had playing in their game. In the future, I'd like to incorporate more animation in my games.

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?

Although the README is helpful, I'd suggest having an instruction screen flash before the game starts. When I first played the game I had
no idea what I was supposed to do.

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?

The multiple Big_Business_Pressed functions were a bit confusing to me. It seems like they could have done the game with just one of
these functions.

Is it clear that every group member participated?

It seems like this project was only made by one person Griffen Morrison. This is evidenced by the name "Mr Solo Dolo," and the fact that
his name is the only one on the license and README.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

Yes, it lists Griffen Morrison's name.

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

Although it gives a description of the game itself, there aren't any instructions on how to play the game.

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.

I like how you utilized Godot's group function on the buttons.

How many of your points would you allocate to this project?
