Group's repository: https://github.com/kittenatheart/C220-Final



What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?
Our economy is probably going to suffer a lot from this pandemic
 

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?
It simulates the stimulus checks that the government is introducing to help the economy in these trying times
brough on by COVID-19.
 

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?
I love that it feels like a meme. These kinds of games are very fun because of the imagery and almost the audacity 
of the idea behind the game. The idea that you must play as the government and try to save the economy even 
though you'll most likely fail is a very nihilistic veiw and I relate.
 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?
A little more instruction on how to play would be helpful, and the business buttons come and go so quickly
 

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?
The script actually helped me understand better how to play the game and how to get a "good" ending.
 

Is it clear that every group member participated?
Since this was a one-person group, it is clear that he worked hard on this.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes
 

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
Where the gif came from
 

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.
It's awesome that you decided to take on a project where you had to code it all, using none of the code from 
previous projects.


How many of your points would you allocate to this project?
1.5
